## 🧐 Project Overview

In high-velocity sales environments, **Lead Leakage** is the silent killer of growth.  
Leads often disappear into spreadsheets, inboxes, or fragmented communication channels.

**Ncs-LeadFlow** was engineered to eliminate this chaos.

It acts as a **centralized sales intelligence hub**, tracking the complete lifecycle of a prospect — from first inquiry to successful conversion — with **real-time synchronization**, **activity intelligence**, and **zero operational friction**.

## 🌟 Core Functionalities

### 📋 Intelligent Lead Management
A high-performance management hub offering dynamic table views with advanced multi-parameter filtering.  
The **Inline-Edit System** enables instant updates directly from the main view, reducing administrative overhead by up to **90%**.

---

### ⏳ Proactive Follow-Up System
LeadFlow functions as a digital sales assistant.  
It continuously analyzes next follow-up dates and highlights leads as **Overdue**, **Due Today**, or **Upcoming**, ensuring no opportunity is ever missed.

---

### 📞 Interaction & Call Intelligence
Every conversation matters.  
The **Call History module** maintains a chronological paper trail of discussions, pain points, and next steps — ensuring full context even during lead reassignment.

### 📊 Data-Driven Dashboard
A 30,000-foot view of sales performance:

- Conversion rates  
- 30-day lead generation trends  
- Team workload distribution  

This empowers leadership to make decisions backed by data — not intuition.

| Role | Access Scope | Responsibilities |
|----|----|----|
| 👑 **Administrator** | Global | User management, lead reassignment, performance analytics, credential control |
| 👤 **Employee** | Assigned Leads Only | Personal pipeline management, follow-ups, interaction logging |
